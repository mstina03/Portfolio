            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My name is Tina. I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Information Systems from Tuskegee University
            in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 2007, I accepted a position as a windows application developer with Walmart
            Information Systems Division (now known as Walmart Labs). During the company's 2009 reorg, I accepted a position as a 
            Release Engineer where I have spent the majority of my career.  As a Release Engineer my responsibility transfered 
            from building applications to releasing them. During this time I acquired project and time management skills, 
            as well as the ability to communicate with team members and business customers while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines. 
            I recently accepted a Software Engineer position on a web development team were I make enhancements to existing websites 
            and assist in creating new inhouse websites. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            As a windows developer I developer a strong backgroud in C# and VB.net. After joining a web development team, my 
            interest in website development grew. To supplement my self learning, I joined a web development bootcamp and obtain 
            a Web Development Certification from Texas A&M University. Through this bootcamp I was able to grain valuable skills 
            creating websites from begining to end and now process a strong knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In my free time I enjoy low key things like catching up on the latest action movie, reading a good romance novel, or 
            listening to the latest audible e-book.
